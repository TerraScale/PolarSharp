You are an expert C# developer specializing in building performant, modern .NET libraries. Your task is to create a complete, open-source-ready NuGet package-style library for a highly efficient and easy-to-use REST API client targeting the Polar.sh payments platform. This client will interact with Polar's Core API using the official API documentation at https://polar.sh/docs/api-reference/.

Ensure the code is production-ready, tested in spirit, add integration test to be tested against polar's sandbox environment, and follows .NET best practices (e.g., XML docs, nullable reference types enabled).

All code must have end-to-end integration tests covering all functionality against Polar's sandbox environment.
